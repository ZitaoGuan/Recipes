    <h1>Lemon Garlic Pork Chops with Parmesan Tater Tots Recipe</h1>
    <h4>Duration: 20 minutes</h4>
    <h4>Serving Size: 4</h4>
    <h4>List of Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 pound frozen Tater Tots
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese
        </li>
        <li>
            Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            12 ounces green beans, trimmed and halved
        </li>
        <li>
            4 tablespoons unsalted butter
        </li>
        <li>
            Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
        </li>
        <li>
            4 3/4-inch-thick boneless center-cut pork chops (1 1/2 pounds)
        </li>
        <li>
            3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bake the Tater Tots as the label directs. Transfer to a bowl; add the parmesan, season with salt and pepper and toss. Set aside.
        Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the green beans and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to a medium bowl; toss with 1 tablespoon butter, the lemon zest, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover to keep warm.
        Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the pork chops with salt and pepper; add to the skillet and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and let rest.
        Add the garlic to the skillet and cook until lightly browned, about 30 seconds. Add the lemon juice and chicken broth; cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Swirl in the remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Spoon the pan sauce over the pork chops and serve with the Tater Tots and green beans.
